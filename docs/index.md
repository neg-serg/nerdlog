# Nerdlog documentation

Nerdlog is a fast, remote-first, multi-host TUI log viewer with timeline histogram and no central server. Loosely inspired by Graylog/Kibana, but without the bloat. Pretty much no setup needed, either.

It's laser-focused on being efficient while querying logs from multiple remote machines simultaneously, filtering them by time range and patterns, while also drawing a timeline histogram for quick visual insight.
